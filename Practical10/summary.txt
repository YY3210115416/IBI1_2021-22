Finding: 
1. The comparison between human and mouse:
                  The alignment score: 1490
                  The percentage of identical amino acides:0.965

2. The comparison between human and random sequence:
                  The alignment score: -351
                  The percentage of identical amino acides:0.028

3. The comparison between mouse and random sequence:
                  The alignment score: -348
                  The percentage of identical amino acides:0.031

Interpretation: 
In the comparison between human and mouse, the percentage of identical amino acides of DLX5 protein is about 0.965, 
                        which indicates that Human and mouse cells may perform a kind of similar function. It is also possible that human and mouse
                        are closely related and may have a common ancestor.
